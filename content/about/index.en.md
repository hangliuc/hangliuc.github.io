### ❔ Why This Blog

- Build a private knowledge base, record the problems and solutions encountered in work, and turn one-time experience into long-term reusable assets. Try to avoid updating basic knowledge, as these can be easily found through browser searches, enhancing the ability to search for knowledge.

- During the setup process, I also integrated and re-learned some technologies, such as docker, nginx, certbot... For work production environments, some basic knowledge may not be used (such as nginx configuration, docker-compose, etc.), but some problems will be encountered during the setup process, and there will be some new insights. I will also use Go to write some backend code to implement some features.

- Practice a complete small project from 0 to 1, such as monitoring and alerting systems, ELK logs, CDN acceleration and caching strategies, etc.

- Of course, it can also be used as a resume showcase, and integrated with various technical platforms to enhance one's technical level and commercial value.

**If you have any suggestions or questions, please feel free to comment or contact me.**
