This is my first Hugo blog!

## Why Choose Hugo?
As an SRE, I appreciate the simplicity and purity of static binary files.

## Hugo Directory Structure
content/: Stores your Markdown articles (database).

layouts/ & themes/: Stores frontend code (HTML/CSS templates).

static/: Stores images, CNAME files, and other static resources.

hugo.toml (or .yaml/.json): The configuration file for the entire site (similar to k8s's configmap).
